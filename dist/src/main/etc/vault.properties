# Vault EL functions, vault:read() and vault:readWithDelay(), are deprecated.
# Use instead the CredentialStore EL functions with a Vault implementation.
#
# Vault configuration should be set in the credential-stores.properties file. Previous Vault configuration property
# names must be added to the credentials-store.properties file prefixed with 'credentialStore.vault.'.
#
#
# For backwards compatibility, you can specify with the following property, the ID of the Vault CredentialStore
# you want to be used with the deprecated functions.
#

#vaultEL.credentialStore.id=vault
