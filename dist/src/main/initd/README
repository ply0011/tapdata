StreamSets Data Collector Unix init.d script installation

You'll need root or sudo privileges to perform these steps.

Copy the '_sdcinitd_prototype' script to the '/etc/init.d/' directory as
'sdc.initd'

Edit the 'sdc.initd' file and set the SDC_DIST environment variable to
the base directory of the data collector binaries.

Make the 'sdc.initd' file executable.

Configure the system to start/stop the data collector at startup/shutdown.
This can be done using the install_initd Linux command. Refer to your Linux
documentation for details.

Create a system user/group to run the data collector. The default user/group
are 'sdc/sdc'

Create an '/etc/sdc/' directory and copy the files in '$SDC_DIST/etc/' to it.

  User to run the sdc daemon: sdc
  Group to run the sdc daemon: sdc
  Data collector configuration directory: /etc/sdc/
  Data collector log directory: /var/log/sdc/
  Data collector data directory: /var/run/sdc/

If you need to change any of these values to a custom value, edit the
'$SDC_DIST/libexec/sdcd-env.sh' script to the required custom values.
